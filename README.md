# The Most Unhinged Playlists  

## Project Description  
A site where users can submit, browse, and vote on the most bizarre, cursed, or strangely niche playlists.  
From *"Songs to Listen to While Your Sim Drowns"* to *"Music for a Dramatic Staring Contest"*, users can experience insane but strangely familiar sets of songs.  

## Core Features  

- **Submit Playlist**: Users can submit their own wacky playlist suggestions with title, description, and track listing.  
- **Vote & Comment**: Users can like, dislike, and comment on playlists.  
- **Personalized Feeds**: Users can view trending, highest-voted, or algorithmically suggested playlists.  
- **Playlist Sharing**: The ability to make shareable links for playlists.  
- **Dark Mode**: Because cursed playlists deserve cursed aesthetics.  

## Tech Stack  

- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS  
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js  
- **Database**: MongoDB / Firebase  
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth / JWT  
- **Hosting**: Vercel (Frontend), Render / Railway (Backend)  

## Why This Project?  
This project combines humor, music discovery, and social engagement. It’s a fun, interactive way to explore full-stack development, authentication, API design, and UI/UX.  

After all, who wouldn’t appreciate a playlist called *"Songs to Walk Like a Villain To"* or wonder what’s actually going on in people’s heads?
